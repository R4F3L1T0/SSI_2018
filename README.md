# Synchrotron Loss due to Dark Photons
### This repository contains the project I developed in collaboration with an International Team of PhD Students, Post-docs and Researchers at the SSI (SLAC Summer Institute).

**The task** <br/>
Electrons in a circular accelerator will emit a substantial amount of electromagnetic radiation. Consider an extension of electrodynamics where a new particle, the dark photon, exists with a mass of 10 MeV which couples to charged particles the same way as a photon does but with a strength reduced by *k* = 10<sup>-3</sup> and estimate the power loss due to the emission of dark photons in a circular accelerator, such as the proposed *FCC-ee* or *CEPC*, with a center of mass energy of 250 GeV.

**Our conclusion** <br/>
The Synchrotron radiation emitted by a Dark Photon can not be detected at proposed upcoming *e<sup>+</sup>* *e<sup>-</sup>* colliders like *CEPC* and *FCC-ee*. <br/>
There exists extreme suppression by high mass compared to available energy. Hence the power due to Dark Photon would be naught. The Synchrotron radiation due to lower mass dark photon might bevisible, however the dark photon with lower mass has already been excluded by former experiments for reasonable couplings. A Dark Photon with the given mass and coupling would be visible at an electron beam-energy of 1 PeV in a tinyring using 100 T magnets.

**Work Environment** <br/>
The SLAC Summer Institute (SSI) is an annual two-week-long Summer School tradition since 1973. Lectures are given Monday through Friday each morning. The afternoons contain a mixture of special lectures, topical conference talks, discussion sessions, student projects and tours. In the evenings, there are social activities and student poster sessions. The attendance is typically a mixture from graduate students to postdocs, as well as senior researchers. <bw/>
The 2018 SLAC Summer Institute celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Standard Model (SM) with a broad overview of the multiple successes and the various challenges that the SM still faces. In addition to a survey of the historical development of the different components of the SM, the contemporary theoretical and experimental framework of the SM will be reviewed with prospects of new horizon beyond it. <br/>
The SSI projects are designed to engage students and postdocs on topics related to the theme of an SSI. Participants are grouped into teams, which work during the Institute and give a report during the project concluding the presentation session on the final day.
